## Remaining Tasks

### [X] Wire Friend Requests Through Social Hub And Twin-Harness Verification

**Raw source:** add a social feature, e.g., friend request. implement it via search and button (e.g., in settings or new people tab). after adding them in your app, add them in your friends app, see them in your app. test everything. Update docs.

**Issue:** Backend friend-request endpoints exist, and `SocialHubScreen` already has a user search tab with a person-add button, but the button only shows "not yet implemented." Search results also do not expose relationship state, incoming requests are not surfaced in Flutter, and accepted friend state is not cached locally for downstream habit invites, nudges, leaderboards, or twin-app verification.

**Ponytail triage:**
- *Should exist:* Yes, accepted friendship is the gate for habit partnerships and later shared habit visibility.
- *Smallest safe scope:* Reuse `SocialHubScreen` as the "Find Friends" surface, wire the existing add button to send friend requests, add a compact incoming request list with accept/decline, cache relationship state locally, and verify the flow between `primary` and `friend` app flavors.
- *Skipped scope:* New settings tab, contact import, QR/user-code invites, push notifications, chat, blocking/reporting, public profiles, friend suggestions, and full 3D social browsing.
- *Boundaries:* Friend search may be an explicit network action, but request status and accepted relationships should be cached into Drift for offline-first reads. Search must not expose habit metadata or private journal data.

**Action:** Complete the friend-request flow end to end. Update the backend search/request APIs to be idempotent and privacy-safe, add request listing/accept/decline support, wire Flutter's Social Hub button and request list to those APIs through Riverpod/Drift state, and verify primary-to-friend plus friend-to-primary visibility in the twin harness.

**Hable perspective:** Friendships are a social permission layer, not shared habit data by themselves. Accepted friends can later receive habit-partner invites, but simply becoming friends must not reveal habit lists, logs, skip journal text, partner snapshots, private messages, or milestone events.

**Implementation scope:**
- Backend routes in `backend/src/index.ts`: harden `POST /api/social/friend-request`, add/verify duplicate and self-request guards, add request list and decline endpoints if missing, and update `GET /api/social/search` to return `user_id`, `username`, `avatar_url`, and `relationship_state` only.
- Backend schema/indexes in `backend/schema.sql`: add indexes for `(requester_id, recipient_id, status)` and enforce or simulate uniqueness for pending/accepted request pairs.
- Drift schema in `lib/database/tables.dart`: add a minimal local friend/request cache table if no existing table can represent pending incoming, pending outgoing, accepted, declined, usernames, avatars, and timestamps.
- Database methods in `lib/database/database.dart`: upsert friend request/search relationship state, watch pending incoming requests, watch accepted friends, and update status optimistically on accept/decline.
- Riverpod/social state in `lib/providers/social_providers.dart` or a small companion provider: expose friend requests, accepted friends, send request, accept request, and decline request actions.
- UI in `lib/screens/social/social_hub_screen.dart`: replace the placeholder add-button snackbar with real send behavior; show request state labels/buttons; add an incoming requests section/tab without creating a new broad social screen.
- Sync layer in `lib/services/sync_service.dart`: pull request state through `/api/sync/daily` or a dedicated social request endpoint and persist it locally; keep UI non-blocking when offline.
- Twin harness/testing: update `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md` and `08_Testing.md` with primary sends request to friend, friend accepts, primary sees accepted relationship, then reverse or re-run from friend side as needed.
- Test surface: focused backend/API smoke checks for search state, duplicate requests, self-request rejection, accept/decline authorization, and one device/emulator twin-harness pass.

**Scalability considerations:** Friend search should stay prefix/equality based with a small limit and indexed usernames. Friend request lookups need indexed requester/recipient/status pairs before the graph grows. A full friend graph service, pagination, and recommendation system are deferred.

**Future split guidance:** Habit partner invitation from habit creation/edit, friend profile pages, friend blocking, push notifications, contact import, and 3D friend exploration should remain separate tasks. Implement them only after this accepted-friend primitive works.

**Edge cases:** Searching yourself, duplicate request taps, reciprocal pending requests, accepting a missing/rejected request, stale token, user deleted after request, offline during send/accept, declined requests re-sent later, relationship state not refreshing in the sender app, seeded twin users already connected in D1, search leaking `total_score` or habit data, and accepted friendship without any shared habits.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Social Hub search results show safe fields plus relationship state (`none`, `pending_incoming`, `pending_outgoing`, `accepted`, or equivalent).
- Tapping the existing add/friend button sends a real friend request and updates local/request UI state without blocking unrelated app use.
- Incoming friend requests are visible in the receiving app with accept and decline actions.
- Accepting a request updates backend state and both installs eventually show the relationship as accepted.
- Duplicate friend requests and self-requests are rejected or treated idempotently.
- Accepted friends still do not expose habit metadata until a separate habit partnership/invite exists.
- The primary app can send a request to the friend app, the friend app can accept it, and the primary app can see accepted state after refresh/sync.
- The same flow is verified from the friend app side or documented as already covered by the symmetric backend path.
- `04_Social_and_Analytics.md`, `07_Multi_User_Social_Features.md`, `02_Offline_Architecture.md`, `03_UI_UX_and_Animations.md`, `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md`, and `08_Testing.md` are verified and updated to match the implemented flow.

**Dependencies:** `04_Social_and_Analytics.md`, `07_Multi_User_Social_Features.md`, `02_Offline_Architecture.md`, `03_UI_UX_and_Animations.md`, `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md`, `08_Testing.md`

### [X] Complete Cross-App Habit Lifecycle Sync And Twin-Harness Verification

**Raw source:** Add a habit, set a time, sync it, update it, delete it. see it in your friends app (if you added them as friend), update it in your friends app, see it in your app. do the same for multi-day habits. after adding them in your app, add them in your friends app, see them in your app. test everything. Update docs.

**Issue:** Profile habit CRUD exists locally, but cross-app habit lifecycle sync is not real yet. `createHabitWithSync`, `updateHabitDetails`, `archiveHabit`, completion, and skip actions enqueue `SyncAction.createHabit`, `updateHabit`, and `logHabit`; `SyncService` currently mocks those actions instead of sending habit/log records to Cloudflare. The backend has social partnerships and `habit_progress`, but no complete authorized habit metadata lifecycle that lets the primary/friend installs see shared habit create/update/archive/log changes from each other.

**Ponytail triage:**
- *Should exist:* Yes, this is the smallest root-cause fix needed before twin-app habit testing can mean anything.
- *Smallest safe scope:* Implement real sync for create, update, archive, and log actions; pull shared habit metadata/progress through daily sync; verify one shared normal habit and one multi-day habit across `primary` and `friend` flavors.
- *Skipped scope:* Hard delete, reminders, recurring schedules, calendar integration, realtime sockets, conflict-resolution UI, bulk editing, public friend habit feeds, and full automation frameworks.
- *Boundaries:* Keep Hable privacy rules. Friends must not see every habit automatically; cross-app visibility requires an accepted friendship plus explicit partnership/habit invite. Treat "delete" as archive/abandon unless a future task explicitly requires destructive deletion.

**Action:** Replace the mocked habit/log sync path with a real offline-first lifecycle. Local Drift remains the optimistic source for UI. Background sync sends queued habit/log mutations to authenticated backend endpoints, the backend persists and authorizes shared habit state, and daily sync pulls only allowed shared habit metadata/progress into the other app. Then run the twin harness to prove add/time/update/archive/log behavior works in both directions for a normal habit and a multi-day habit.

**Hable perspective:** The Home and Profile screens should continue to read only Drift/Riverpod streams. The backend is only the reconciliation layer. Partner visibility belongs to accepted relationships and per-habit partnerships, not general friendship. Shared updates must not expose private skip journal text or unrelated habit lists.

**Implementation scope:**
- Drift schema/DAO: audit `Habits`, `Logs`, `Partnerships`, `SyncQueue`, and `PartnerSnapshots`; add only the minimum field needed to represent "set a time" without corrupting multi-day duration semantics if the current `targetDuration/currentDuration` fields are insufficient.
- Database methods in `lib/database/database.dart`: enqueue full payloads for create/update/archive/log instead of only `habitId`; mark local rows synced only after backend success.
- Sync layer in `lib/services/sync_service.dart`: replace the mocked `SyncAction.createHabit`, `SyncAction.updateHabit`, and `SyncAction.logHabit` branch with real authenticated HTTP calls and retry-safe error handling.
- Backend D1/schema: add or align full habit metadata storage, progress/log upserts, shared-habit authorization, status/archive handling, updated timestamps, and needed indexes for `user_id`, `habit_id`, partnership lookups, and updated sync ordering.
- Backend routes in `backend/src/index.ts`: implement authenticated habit create/update/archive/log endpoints and extend `/api/sync/daily` to return only authorized shared habit metadata and partner progress.
- Riverpod/UI: keep `ProfileScreen`, `HabitFormSheet`, `HomeScreen`, and `PartnerTicker` wired to local Drift; add only minimal UI/state hooks needed to show shared synced habits after daily sync.
- Twin harness/testing: update `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md` and/or `08_Testing.md` with exact steps for primary-to-friend and friend-to-primary habit lifecycle testing; run the path on a device/emulator.
- Test surface: focused backend/API smoke checks for habit create/update/archive/log authorization plus one device smoke pass through the twin harness.

**Scalability considerations:** Habit and log sync can be one queued mutation per request for now. Add D1 indexes before shared habits grow, and keep daily sync scoped to accepted/partnered habits. If offline queues grow after long offline use, batch habit/log mutations in a separate task.

**Future split guidance:** Batch sync, hard deletion, conflict-resolution UI, realtime shared updates, reminders, and CI-grade device automation are deferred. Append separate raw tasks only after this bidirectional lifecycle works manually.

**Edge cases:** User is offline during create/update/archive/log, missing or expired JWT, friend request accepted but no habit partnership, invite pending/declined, user tries to see non-partner habits, duplicate queued updates, update/archive conflict from both apps, archive after completion, restore after archive, local row marked synced after failed backend call, stale daily sync payload, private skip journal leaking to partner payloads, duration unit mismatch between daily time and multi-day journey, and seeded harness data diverging from D1.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Creating a habit from Profile writes Drift immediately and syncs the full habit metadata to the backend instead of being mocked.
- Setting/updating the habit time/duration preserves correct multi-day habit semantics and does not inflate day counts through unit mismatch.
- Updating title, duration/time, and color in one install syncs and appears in the partnered install after daily sync.
- Archiving a habit in one install removes it from active lists in both partnered installs after sync while preserving history locally.
- Completing and skipping a habit enqueue real `logHabit` payloads; skip journal text stays private and is not exposed to partners.
- A normal shared habit and a multi-day shared habit can be created from `primary`, seen/updated from `friend`, then seen back in `primary`.
- A shared habit created from `friend` can be seen in `primary` after sync.
- Non-partner friends cannot see private habit metadata.
- `SyncService` no longer mocks `createHabit`, `updateHabit`, or `logHabit`.
- `01_Schema_and_Core_Logic.md`, `02_Offline_Architecture.md`, `03_UI_UX_and_Animations.md`, `04_Social_and_Analytics.md`, `07_Multi_User_Social_Features.md`, `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md`, and `08_Testing.md` are verified and updated to match the implemented lifecycle.

**Dependencies:** `01_Schema_and_Core_Logic.md`, `02_Offline_Architecture.md`, `03_UI_UX_and_Animations.md`, `04_Social_and_Analytics.md`, `07_Multi_User_Social_Features.md`, `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md`, `08_Testing.md`

**Implementation progress notes:**
- Implemented shared standard habit presets in `lib/data/standard_habits.dart` and reused them from onboarding plus `HabitFormSheet`.
- Updated `HabitFormSheet` to create/edit habits in days, prefill preset title/duration/color, and offer accepted-friend partner chips from Drift/Riverpod.
- Updated `AppDatabase.createHabitWithSync` and `HabitActionsController.createHabit` to return the created habit id, enqueue full habit metadata, and enqueue `sendHabitInvitation` items after the local habit exists.
- Hardened `POST /api/social/habit-invitation` to require requester habit ownership, accepted friendship, non-self target, and idempotent duplicate pending invites.
- Updated docs in `01_Schema_and_Core_Logic.md`, `02_Offline_Architecture.md`, `03_UI_UX_and_Animations.md`, `04_Social_and_Analytics.md`, `07_Multi_User_Social_Features.md`, `TWIN_TEST_HARNESS.md`, and `08_Testing.md`.
- Verified: `flutter analyze`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `flutter test`, and `flutter build apk --debug`.
- Added optimistic completion-state repair in `lib/database/database.dart` so local remaining days decrement and habits move to `completed` only when they actually hit zero.
- Updated `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` so completion/skip logs flush the sync queue immediately and skip payloads no longer send private journal text to the backend.
- Updated `lib/services/sync_service.dart` to mark pushed habits/logs as synced after backend success and to reconcile inbound shared habits using backend status plus viewer remaining days instead of forcing `active` + zero progress.
- Extended `GET /api/sync/daily` in `backend/src/index.ts` to return shared-habit `status` and `viewer_remaining_days` for local reconciliation.
- Verified the lifecycle fixes with `flutter analyze`, `flutter test test/profile_habit_crud_test.dart test/habit_completion_progress_test.dart`, and `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Added repeatable backend lifecycle smoke script at `backend/scripts/lifecycle-smoke.mjs` and exposed it as `npm run smoke:lifecycle`.
- Verified local backend with `npm run db:setup` and a direct API lifecycle smoke covering seeded auth, case-insensitive friend search, friend acceptance, normal shared habit sync, multi-day shared habit sync, Bob-owned habit visibility in Alice, completion progress, owner-only metadata update enforcement, archive propagation, and private habit exclusion.
- Verified emulator harness setup on `emulator-5554`: `adb reverse tcp:8787 tcp:8787`, built `app-primary-debug.apk` and `app-friend-debug.apk` with seeded identities, installed both packages, launched both flavors, and dumped UI hierarchies showing Alice/Bob each reach Home with the reciprocal shared Hydration card.
- Remaining before completion: full tap-by-tap lifecycle UI verification is still not complete because the local MobAI device controller described by the mobile-control skill is not exposed in this session. Backend/API lifecycle and flavor boot verification are complete, but manual or MobAI-driven device interaction is still needed for habit create/edit/archive/log from the Flutter UI.
- Progress noted at 2026-07-11 14:46 CEST.
